# Dependency Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed unused dependencies from the MEXC Sniper Bot project as specified in the CODEBASE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md.

## Dependencies Removed

### Production Dependencies
1. **swr** (`^2.2.5`) - Replaced by TanStack Query throughout the codebase
2. **@vercel/blob** (`^1.1.1`) - Not used anywhere in the codebase

### Development Dependencies
1. **eslint** (`^9`) - Replaced by Biome for linting and formatting

## Configuration Changes

### 1. Next.js Configuration
- Removed ESLint configuration from `next.config.ts`
- The project now relies solely on Biome for code quality checks

### 2. ESLint Configuration Files
- Deleted `.eslintrc.override.js` file
- No other ESLint configuration files were found

## Verification

### 1. No Import References Found
- Verified no imports of `swr` in the codebase
- Verified no imports of `@vercel/blob` in the codebase
- Verified no imports of `eslint` in TypeScript/JavaScript files

### 2. Build and Lint Still Work
- ✅ Dependencies installed successfully with `bun install`
- ✅ Biome linting works with `bun run lint:check`
- ✅ Type checking reveals pre-existing TypeScript errors (not related to dependency removal)

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removing unused dependencies reduces the overall bundle size
2. **Simplified Toolchain**: Using only Biome instead of both ESLint and Biome
3. **Cleaner Dependencies**: Eliminates confusion about which data fetching library to use (TanStack Query is the standard)

## Notes

- The project has pre-existing TypeScript errors that are unrelated to this dependency cleanup
- The `claude-flow` package was not found in package.json (may have been removed earlier)
- All core functionality remains intact after removing these dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Run `bun install` to update lock file with the cleaned dependencies
2. Consider fixing the pre-existing TypeScript errors in a separate task
3. Update any documentation that mentions the removed tools
