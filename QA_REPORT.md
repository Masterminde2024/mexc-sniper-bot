# Quality Assurance Report

**Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Agent:** Quality Assurance Agent  
**Project:** MEXC Sniper Bot  

## Executive Summary

The QA process has identified several critical issues that need to be addressed before the project can be considered production-ready. While tests are passing, there are significant linting, type checking, and build issues that require immediate attention.

## Quality Check Results

### ✅ Dependencies Status
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:** All dependencies are properly installed via Bun package manager
- **Node modules:** Present with 714 directories
- **Package configuration:** Valid package.json with proper scripts

### ❌ Linting Check
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Tool:** Biome linter
- **Issues Found:** 
  - 127 errors
  - 3,557 warnings
  - Primary issues: Unused imports, unused variables, explicit `any` types
- **Action Required:** Manual code cleanup needed
- **Impact:** Code quality and maintainability concerns

### ❌ TypeScript Type Checking
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Tool:** TypeScript compiler (tsc --noEmit)
- **Critical Issues:**
  - Property 'vcoinId' does not exist on pattern detection types
  - Property 'execute' does not exist on database query types
  - Invalid await operand types in strategy initialization service
- **Action Required:** Type definition fixes and interface alignment

### ✅ Test Suite
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Results:** 29/29 tests passed across 5 test files
- **Test Types:** Unit tests, integration tests, component tests
- **Duration:** 4.41 seconds
- **Coverage:** Multiple test suites including sniping system API integration
- **Note:** One minor warning about multiple GoTrueClient instances (non-critical)

### ❌ Production Build
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Tool:** Next.js build process
- **Critical Issue:** Webpack error with Node.js built-in modules
- **Root Cause:** `src/services/data/websocket-client.ts` imports `node:events` which is not available in browser context
- **File Path:** Import trace: websocket-client.ts → use-websocket.ts → real-time-dashboard.tsx → dashboard/page.tsx
- **Action Required:** Replace Node.js EventEmitter with browser-compatible alternative

### ✅ Build Artifact Cleanup
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Cleaned `.next` directory
  - Verified `.gitignore` properly excludes:
    - `/.next/` (Next.js build output)
    - `/build` (general build directory)
    - `*.tsbuildinfo` (TypeScript build info)
    - `/dist/` (distribution directory)

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Websocket Client Node.js Dependency (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File:** `/Users/neo/Developer/mexc-sniper-bot/src/services/data/websocket-client.ts`  
**Issue:** Line 16 imports `EventEmitter` from `"node:events"`  
**Solution:** Replace with browser-compatible event emitter or use custom implementation  

### 2. Type System Integrity (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Files:** Multiple files in pattern detection and database layers  
**Issue:** Inconsistent type definitions causing compilation failures  
**Solution:** Align interface definitions and fix property access patterns  

### 3. Code Quality Standards (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Scope:** Project-wide  
**Issue:** 3,684 total linting issues  
**Solution:** Systematic cleanup of unused imports, variables, and type annotations  

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Production)
1. **Fix Node.js imports** in websocket client to enable successful builds
2. **Resolve TypeScript errors** to ensure type safety
3. **Address critical linting issues** especially unused imports affecting tree-shaking

### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Implement stricter linting rules** to prevent future regressions
2. **Add pre-commit hooks** to enforce code quality standards
3. **Increase test coverage** for pattern detection and database layers

### Build Process Verification
- ✅ Makefile commands are properly configured
- ✅ Dependencies are installed correctly
- ✅ Test framework is operational
- ❌ Production build requires fixes before deployment

## Final Assessment

**Overall Status:** ⚠️ **REQUIRES FIXES BEFORE PRODUCTION**

The project has a solid foundation with passing tests and proper dependency management, but cannot be deployed due to build failures and type checking issues. The most critical blocker is the Node.js module import in the websocket client that prevents browser compatibility.

**Estimated Time to Fix:** 2-4 hours for critical issues, 1-2 days for comprehensive code quality improvements.
