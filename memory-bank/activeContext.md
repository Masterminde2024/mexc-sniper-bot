# Active Context (2025-07-04)

## Current Focus
**SUPABASE AUTH MIGRATION COMPLETE** - Successfully migrated from NextAuth to Supabase with comprehensive rate limit handling and production-ready configuration.

## Recent Major Changes
- **🔐 Complete Supabase Auth Migration**: Fully migrated from NextAuth/Kinde to Supabase with advanced rate limit handling
- **⚡ Rate Limit Solutions**: Intelligent detection, user-friendly UI, SMTP bypass, and development tools  
- **🧹 Environment Cleanup**: Removed ALL NextAuth references, added comprehensive SMTP configuration
- **🧪 Comprehensive Auth Testing**: Complete test suite covering unit, integration, and e2e auth scenarios
- **📚 Extensive Documentation**: Migration guides, SMTP setup, troubleshooting, and developer onboarding
- **🎯 Production Ready**: Custom SMTP configuration to bypass Supabase's 2 emails/hour rate limit
- **🔧 Advanced Error Handling**: Circuit breaker patterns, retry logic, and graceful degradation
- **✅ Authentication UX**: Rate limit notices, countdown timers, and development bypass functionality

## Next Steps (Short-Term)
1. **Auth System Production Deployment** - Deploy updated Supabase auth system with SMTP configuration
2. **E2E Auth Testing** - Complete comprehensive Playwright tests for all auth scenarios  
3. **Rate Limit Monitoring** - Implement production monitoring and alerting for auth rate limits
4. **Trading System Integration** - Ensure trading features work seamlessly with new auth system
5. **P0 Critical Priority Tests** - Complete 80% coverage baseline for core trading, MEXC API, risk management
6. **Production Issue Resolution** - Verify auth endpoint 500 errors are resolved with Supabase migration

## Important Decisions & Considerations
- **Documentation First** – Memory Bank is single source of truth; must be updated after every significant change.
- **File Size Limit** – All code files limited to <500 LOC; modular design enforced.
- **Security** – No secrets committed; environment variables stored in `.env.*` only.

## Patterns & Preferences
- SPARC workflow, Taskmaster for task management, Bun + Make for scripts.
- Testing stack: Vitest + Playwright + Stagehand.

## Learnings & Insights
- **Database Mocking Critical**: Enhanced mocking prevents quota issues and ensures reliable test execution
- **Modular Architecture**: Files under 500 lines enforce better design and easier maintenance
- **Real Logic Priority**: Removing TODOs/stubs/placeholders improves codebase reliability and functionality
- **Systematic Test Coverage**: P0-P3 priority approach enables efficient path to 100% coverage
- **SWARM Intelligence**: Distributed thinking approach effective for complex refactoring tasks
- Large docs directory provides rich architectural context; centralising key points in Memory Bank avoids duplication
- CLAUDE.md enforces Bun/Make workflow which aligns with SPARC philosophy
