# Active Context (2025-06-29)

## Current Focus
**100% Test Coverage Implementation** - Systematic implementation of comprehensive test coverage across all critical systems using SWARM intelligence approach with P0-P3 priority levels.

## Recent Changes
- **REFACTORING_PLAN.md Implementation**: Completed file consolidation and script organization
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Added core-orchestrator.test.ts and mexc-authentication-service.test.ts
- **Database Mocking Enhancement**: Strengthened vitest-setup.ts to prevent quota exceeded errors
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Fixed all compilation errors including missing calculateOptimalEntry method
- **TODO Cleanup**: Converted 8 files from placeholders to real implementations
- **Multi-Phase Trading Bot**: Enhanced with real market analysis and position management
- **Test Infrastructure**: Moved test files from scripts/ to tests/ directory per refactoring plan
- **Memory Bank Documentation**: Updated with latest comprehensive refactoring progress

## Next Steps (Short-Term)
1. **P0 Critical Priority Tests** - Complete 80% coverage baseline for core trading, MEXC API, risk management
2. **P1-P2 Test Implementation** - Build toward 95% coverage with integration and workflow tests
3. **P3 Edge Case Coverage** - Achieve 100% test coverage with comprehensive edge case testing
4. **Build/Typecheck Verification** - Ensure zero compilation errors and all tests pass
5. **Production Issue Resolution** - Investigate and fix auth endpoint 500 errors in production
6. **Memory Bank Automation** - Implement pre-task hooks to automatically load Memory Bank context

## Important Decisions & Considerations
- **Documentation First** – Memory Bank is single source of truth; must be updated after every significant change.
- **File Size Limit** – All code files limited to <500 LOC; modular design enforced.
- **Security** – No secrets committed; environment variables stored in `.env.*` only.

## Patterns & Preferences
- SPARC workflow, Taskmaster for task management, Bun + Make for scripts.
- Testing stack: Vitest + Playwright + Stagehand.

## Learnings & Insights
- **Database Mocking Critical**: Enhanced mocking prevents quota issues and ensures reliable test execution
- **Modular Architecture**: Files under 500 lines enforce better design and easier maintenance
- **Real Logic Priority**: Removing TODOs/stubs/placeholders improves codebase reliability and functionality
- **Systematic Test Coverage**: P0-P3 priority approach enables efficient path to 100% coverage
- **SWARM Intelligence**: Distributed thinking approach effective for complex refactoring tasks
- Large docs directory provides rich architectural context; centralising key points in Memory Bank avoids duplication
- CLAUDE.md enforces Bun/Make workflow which aligns with SPARC philosophy
