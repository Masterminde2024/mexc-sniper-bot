# Progress Log

_Last updated: 2025-06-29_

## What Works
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: 16+ specialized TypeScript agents operational with robust coordination
- **Development Environment**: Full local development with Next.js (:3008) + Inngest (:8288) servers
- **Testing Infrastructure**: 350+ automated tests with enhanced mocking and comprehensive coverage
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 powered agents for pattern detection and strategy generation
- **Authentication**: Dual-auth system (Kinde + Supabase) with migration support
- **Database**: Enhanced Drizzle ORM with strengthened mocking to prevent quota issues
- **Trading System**: Multi-phase trading bot with real market analysis and position management
- **Risk Management**: Real-time safety monitoring with circuit breakers and emergency stops
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry instrumentation with distributed tracing
- **Deployment**: Vercel pipeline operational (builds successful)
- **Code Quality**: Biome.js linting/formatting with TypeScript strict mode enforced

## Completed Milestones
- **REFACTORING_PLAN.md Implementation**: File consolidation, script organization, and modular architecture
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Core orchestrator, MEXC API, position manager, and safety system tests
- **Database Infrastructure**: Enhanced mocking system preventing quota exceeded errors
- **Multi-Phase Trading Bot**: Real market analysis with calculateOptimalEntry implementation
- **TODO Cleanup**: 8 files converted from placeholders to real implementations
- **TypeScript Compilation**: All compilation errors resolved with proper type safety
- **Memory Bank Architecture**: Complete Cline-pattern memory bank with all 6 core files
- **Authentication Infrastructure**: Dual-auth support (Kinde + Supabase components)
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive testing with AI-powered E2E via Stagehand v2.3.0
- **API Architecture**: 50+ API routes with validation, rate limiting, and error handling
- **Database Schema**: Complete trading schema with migrations and optimizations
- **Documentation**: Extensive architecture guides, API specs, and testing strategies

## In Progress
- **100% Test Coverage**: Systematic implementation of P0-P3 priority tests for complete coverage
- **Risk Management Tests**: Safety system, emergency protocols, and circuit breaker coverage
- **Agent Coordination Tests**: Workflow engine, registry core, and swarm coordination
- **Production Auth Issue**: Investigating HTTP 500 errors on `/api/auth/*` endpoints in production
- **Memory Bank Automation**: Pre-task hook implemented for automatic context loading
- **Performance Optimization**: OpenAI rate-limiting and circuit breaker improvements

## Next Up
1. Complete P0 Critical Priority tests for 80% coverage baseline
2. Implement P1-P2 tests for 95% coverage target
3. Achieve 100% test coverage with P3 edge case tests
4. (Done) Taskmaster pre-task hook loads Memory Bank context
5. Create CI check ensuring code files stay <500 LOC
6. Strengthen safety agents with real-time circuit-breaker tests

## Known Issues
- **Test Coverage Gaps**: 60+ critical files need P0-P3 test coverage implementation
- **Production Auth 500** â€“ Investigate missing env vars or misconfig on Vercel
- Test flakiness in Playwright E2E under slow network
- Occasional rate-limit responses from OpenAI; consideration for retries/back-off

## Evolution of Decisions
- **Database Mocking**: Enhanced vitest-setup.ts with comprehensive drizzle and postgres mocks
- **Modular Architecture**: Refactored large files into focused modules under 500 lines
- **Real Implementation Priority**: Replaced all TODO/stub/placeholder code with functioning logic
- **Test-First Development**: Systematic test coverage approach with priority-based implementation
- Switched logging from structured pino to simplified console logging (performance gain, easier remote logs)
- Adopted Bun over npm for speed (documented in `CLAUDE.md`)
- Enforced file size limit and modularity across new code
