# Progress Log

_Last updated: 2025-06-29_

## What Works
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: 16+ specialized TypeScript agents operational with robust coordination
- **Development Environment**: Full local development with Next.js (:3008) + Inngest (:8288) servers
- **Testing Infrastructure**: 293+ automated tests achieving >96% pass rate across Vitest, Playwright, and Stagehand
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 powered agents for pattern detection and strategy generation
- **Authentication**: Kinde Auth fully functional in development environment
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with SQLite (dev) and NeonDB (prod) support
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry instrumentation with distributed tracing
- **Deployment**: Vercel pipeline operational (builds successful)
- **Code Quality**: Biome.js linting/formatting with TypeScript strict mode

## Completed Milestones
- **Core Agent System**: Calendar, PatternDiscovery, SymbolAnalysis, Strategy, Safety, and coordination agents
- **Memory Bank Architecture**: Complete Cline-pattern memory bank with all 6 core files
- **Authentication Infrastructure**: Dual-auth support (Kinde + Supabase components)
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive testing with AI-powered E2E via Stagehand v2.3.0
- **API Architecture**: 50+ API routes with validation, rate limiting, and error handling
- **Database Schema**: Complete trading schema with migrations and optimizations
- **Documentation**: Extensive architecture guides, API specs, and testing strategies

## In Progress
- **Production Auth Issue**: Investigating HTTP 500 errors on `/api/auth/*` endpoints in production
- **Supabase Integration**: Finalizing dual-authentication system architecture
- **Memory Bank Automation**: Implementing pre-task hooks for automatic context loading
- **Performance Optimization**: OpenAI rate-limiting and circuit breaker improvements

## Next Up
1. Integrate Memory Bank reading into Taskmaster pre-task hook.
2. Create CI check ensuring code files stay <500 LOC.
3. Strengthen safety agents with real-time circuit-breaker tests.
4. Migrate remaining TODO docs into task tickets.

## Known Issues
- **Production Auth 500** â€“ Investigate missing env vars or misconfig on Vercel.
- Test flakiness in Playwright E2E under slow network.
- Occasional rate-limit responses from OpenAI; consideration for retries/back-off.

## Evolution of Decisions
- Switched logging from structured pino to simplified console logging (performance gain, easier remote logs).
- Adopted Bun over npm for speed (documented in `CLAUDE.md`).
- Enforced file size limit and modularity across new code.
