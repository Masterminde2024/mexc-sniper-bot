    "esbuild": "^0.25.5"
  },
  "drizzle-kit": {
    "@esbuild-kit/esm-loader": {
      "@esbuild-kit/core-utils": {
        "esbuild": "^0.25.5"
      }
    }
  }

**Recommendation**: Environment configuration follows security best practices.

## Additional Security Recommendations

### 7. ðŸ”§ RECOMMENDATION: Security Headers Enhancement

Create a security headers configuration for production deployment:

```typescript
// Recommended security headers for production
const securityHeaders = {
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
};
```

### 8. ðŸ”§ RECOMMENDATION: API Rate Limiting

Current rate limiting configuration is good, but consider implementing:
- âœ… Request rate limiting (already configured)
- ðŸ”§ API key-based rate limiting for different user tiers
- ðŸ”§ Geographic-based rate limiting
- ðŸ”§ Suspicious activity detection

### 9. ðŸ”§ RECOMMENDATION: Input Validation Enhancement

Implement additional input validation for:
- ðŸ”§ API parameter sanitization
- ðŸ”§ SQL injection prevention (already using Drizzle ORM)
- ðŸ”§ Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- ðŸ”§ Command injection prevention
