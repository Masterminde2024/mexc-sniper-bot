## 🚀 Multi-User Testing Results

### ✅ Successfully Tested Scenarios:
1. **Concurrent User Registration:** 5/5 users created successfully
2. **Data Isolation:** User preferences properly isolated between users
3. **Concurrent Operations:** 6/6 API operations completed successfully
4. **Performance Under Load:** System stable after 20 concurrent requests
5. **Session Management:** User sessions created and managed correctly

### 📊 Performance Metrics:
- **API Response Times:** 23ms - 344ms (all under 2-second threshold)

## 🛡️ Security Vulnerability Assessment

### ✅ Protected Against:
- **SQL Injection:** All attempts blocked by Drizzle ORM
- **Most XSS Attacks:** Image and JavaScript protocol attacks blocked
- **Weak Passwords:** Most weak passwords rejected
- **Email Validation:** Invalid email formats rejected
- **Data Access:** Cross-user data properly isolated

### ❌ Vulnerabilities Identified:
1. **XSS Script Tags:** `<script>` tags not fully sanitized
2. **Rate Limiting:** No protection against brute force attacks
3. **Password Strength:** "password" still accepted as valid
4. **Input Validation:** Some malformed data not properly rejected
5. **Session Protection:** No CSRF protection implemented
