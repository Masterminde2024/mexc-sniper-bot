## ⚠️ IDENTIFIED ISSUES & RESOLUTIONS

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

#### 1. Missing Environment Variable
- **Issue**: `KINDE_DOMAIN` environment variable not configured
- **Impact**: Authentication provider domain not specified
- **Priority**: LOW (auth still functional with other variables)
- **Resolution**: Add `KINDE_DOMAIN=your-domain.kinde.com` to environment

#### 2. Database Quota (Development Environment)
- **Issue**: Neon database exceeded data transfer quota during testing
- **Impact**: Some database operations failed in dev environment
- **Priority**: LOW (production database will have adequate quota)
- **Resolution**: Upgrade Neon plan or optimize queries for production
