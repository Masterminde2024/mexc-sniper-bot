# Performance Optimizations

## Overview

This module contains comprehensive performance optimizations implemented by Agent 13/15 - Performance Optimizer. The optimizations focus on caching, lazy loading, memory management, and bundle optimization to improve application performance and reduce resource usage.

## Components

### 1. Performance Cache Optimizer (`performance-cache-optimizer.ts`)
- **Intelligent Prefetching**: Analyzes usage patterns to predict and preload related cache entries
- **Adaptive TTL**: Dynamically adjusts cache TTL based on access frequency
- **Compression**: Automatically compresses cache entries over 1KB threshold
- **Usage Pattern Tracking**: Monitors access patterns for optimization opportunities

### 2. Lazy Loading Optimizer (`lazy-loading-optimizer.ts`)
- **Intersection Observer Integration**: Uses browser APIs for efficient visibility detection
- **Priority-Based Loading**: Loads resources based on critical, high, medium, low priorities
- **Dependency Management**: Handles component dependencies and loading order
- **Concurrency Control**: Limits concurrent loads to prevent resource exhaustion

### 3. Enhanced Memory Manager (`enhanced-memory-manager.ts`)
- **Memory Pooling**: Object, array, and buffer pools for reduced garbage collection
- **Intelligent GC**: Schedules garbage collection based on memory pressure
- **DOM Cleanup**: Removes orphaned DOM elements and optimizes event listeners
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports both Node.js and browser memory management

### 4. Bundle Optimization Service (`bundle-optimization-service.ts`)
- **Dynamic Code Splitting**: Automatically splits large components into chunks
- **Trading Services Optimization**: Specific optimizations for trading components
- **Intelligent Preloading**: Preloads components based on usage patterns
- **Bundle Analysis**: Provides comprehensive bundle performance reports

### 5. Enhanced Performance Optimization (`performance-optimization.ts`)
- **Advanced Bundle Size Estimation**: Uses Performance API for accurate size estimates
- **Resource Prefetching**: Prefetches scripts, images, and critical CSS
- **Lazy Component Creation**: Creates components with intersection observer support

## Integration

```typescript
import { integratedOptimizer } from '@/src/lib/performance-optimizations';

// Initialize all optimizations
await integratedOptimizer.initialize();

// Get comprehensive stats
const stats = integratedOptimizer.getOverallStats();

// Force optimization when needed
await integratedOptimizer.forceOptimization();
```

## Key Features

### Automatic Optimization
- All optimizations run automatically in production
- Memory optimization triggers based on pressure thresholds
- Cache warming occurs during application startup
- Bundle optimization applies during build process

### Memory Management
- Object pooling reduces garbage collection overhead
- Automatic cleanup of unused resources
- Memory leak detection and prevention
- Cross-browser memory optimization

### Cache Strategies
- Multi-level caching with compression
- Intelligent prefetching based on patterns
- Adaptive TTL based on usage frequency
- Batch operations for improved performance

### Loading Optimization
- Priority-based component loading
- Intersection observer for lazy loading
- Dependency-aware loading order
- Preloading based on user behavior

## Performance Metrics

## Usage Examples

### Cache Optimization
```typescript
import { getPerformanceCacheOptimizer } from '@/src/lib/performance-optimizations';

const optimizer = getPerformanceCacheOptimizer(cacheManager);
await optimizer.set('key', data, { compress: true, priority: 'high' });
const result = await optimizer.get('key');
```

### Lazy Loading
```typescript
import { globalLazyLoader, createLazyResource } from '@/src/lib/performance-optimizations';

const resource = createLazyResource('trading-bot', () => import('./trading-bot'), {
  priority: 'critical',
  dependencies: ['risk-manager']
});

const result = await globalLazyLoader.load(resource);
```

### Memory Management
```typescript
import { enhancedMemoryManager } from '@/src/lib/performance-optimizations';

const obj = enhancedMemoryManager.acquireObject();
// ... use object
enhancedMemoryManager.releaseObject(obj);

await enhancedMemoryManager.forceOptimization();
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

The optimization system provides comprehensive monitoring:
- Real-time performance metrics
- Memory usage tracking
- Cache hit rates and patterns
- Bundle loading performance
- Component usage analytics

All metrics integrate with existing performance monitoring systems and provide actionable insights for further optimization.
