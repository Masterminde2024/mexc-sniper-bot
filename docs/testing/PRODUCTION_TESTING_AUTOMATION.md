## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for AI-powered testing
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Stagehand configuration
STAGEHAND_ENV=LOCAL                    # LOCAL or BROWSERBASE
STAGEHAND_HEADLESS=true               # true for CI, false for debugging
STAGEHAND_VERBOSE=false               # true for detailed logging
STAGEHAND_TIMEOUT=30000               # Default timeout in ms

# Application configuration
NODE_ENV=test
PLAYWRIGHT_TEST=true

# Optional: Browserbase integration
BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=your_browserbase_key
BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### Test Configuration

The framework uses unified configuration files:
- `stagehand.config.unified.ts` - Stagehand AI automation settings
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright browser automation
- `vitest.config.unified.ts` - Unit and integration test configuration

### Timeouts and Thresholds

```typescript
const PRODUCTION_CONFIG = {
  timeout: 60000,              // 60 second timeout for production operations
  retries: 3,                  // Number of retry attempts
  waitForStability: 5000,      // Wait 5s for data stability
  minConfidenceScore: 75,      // Minimum pattern confidence
  maxExecutionTime: 30000,     // Max 30s for trade execution
  maxResponseTime: 3000,       // 3 seconds max response time
  minUptime: 99.5,            // Minimum 99.5% uptime requirement
  performanceThreshold: 90,    // Minimum performance score
};
```

## Test Results and Reporting

### Automated Reporting

The framework generates comprehensive reports:

1. **Detailed JSON Report**
   - Location: `reports/production-test-{sessionId}.json`
   - Contains complete test results, metrics, and analysis

2. **Summary Markdown Report**
   - Location: `PRODUCTION_TEST_REPORT.md`
   - Human-readable summary with recommendations

3. **Swarm Memory Integration**
   - Results stored in swarm coordination memory
   - Enables multi-agent collaboration and tracking

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
name: Production Testing
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  production-testing:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install
      - name: Run production tests
        run: make test-production
        env:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
      - name: Upload test reports
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: production-test-reports
          path: reports/
```

### Vercel Deployment Integration

```bash
# Pre-deployment validation
make production-readiness-check

# Deploy only if all tests pass
vercel --prod
```

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging and browser visibility:

```bash
# Run with visible browser and verbose logging
STAGEHAND_HEADLESS=false STAGEHAND_VERBOSE=true make test-production-autosniping

# Debug specific test with UI
npm run test:production:monitoring -- --ui
```

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI API Timeout**
   ```
   Error: OpenAI API request timeout
   Solution: Check API key and increase timeout values
   ```

2. **WebSocket Connection Failures**
   ```
   Error: WebSocket connection failed
   Solution: Verify development server is running and WebSocket endpoints are accessible
   ```

3. **Test Environment Issues**
   ```
   Error: Environment not available
   Solution: Ensure development server is running on http://localhost:3008
   ```

### Performance Optimization

For faster test execution:

1. **Parallel Execution**
   ```bash
   # Run tests in parallel where possible
   npm run test:production:all -- --workers=4
   ```

2. **Targeted Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run only critical path tests
   make test-production-autosniping
   ```

3. **Headless Mode**
   ```bash
   # Always use headless mode in CI
   STAGEHAND_HEADLESS=true make test-production
   ```

## Best Practices

### Test Development

1. **Atomic Tests**: Each test should focus on a specific functionality
2. **Idempotent**: Tests should produce the same results regardless of execution order
3. **Self-contained**: Tests should not depend on external state or previous test runs
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include happy path, error cases, and edge conditions

### Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep test expectations aligned with application changes
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track test execution times and optimize slow tests
3. **Environment Consistency**: Ensure test environments match production configuration
4. **Documentation**: Keep test documentation updated with new features

### Security

1. **Credential Management**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
2. **Test Data**: Use synthetic test data, never production data
3. **Access Control**: Restrict test execution to authorized personnel
4. **Audit Trail**: Maintain logs of test execution and results

## Contributing

When adding new production tests:

1. Follow the established test structure and naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive error handling and recovery testing
3. Add appropriate documentation and comments
4. Ensure tests are environment-agnostic and configurable
5. Include performance benchmarks and success criteria
6. Test both success and failure scenarios

### Test Template

```typescript
test('New production feature validation', async () => {
  const page = stagehand.page;
  console.log('🧪 Testing new production feature');

  // Step 1: Setup and navigation
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3008/feature');
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');

  // Step 2: Feature validation with AI analysis
  const featureAnalysis = await page.extract({
    instruction: "Analyze the new feature functionality",
    schema: z.object({
      isWorking: z.boolean(),
      performance: z.string(),
      errorMessages: z.array(z.string())
    })
  });

  // Step 3: Assertions and validation
  expect(featureAnalysis.isWorking).toBe(true);
  expect(featureAnalysis.errorMessages).toHaveLength(0);

  console.log('✅ New feature validation completed');
});
```
