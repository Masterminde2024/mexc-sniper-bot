## üîç Before You Begin

### Check Existing Issues

Before creating a new issue or pull request, please:

1. **Search existing issues** to see if your problem/idea has already been reported
2. **Check closed issues** as your question may have already been answered
3. **Review pull requests** to ensure you're not duplicating effort

### Create an Issue First

For any significant changes, please create an issue first to discuss:

- **Bug reports**: Describe the bug, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior
- **Feature requests**: Explain the feature and why it would be valuable
- **Architecture improvements**: Suggest enhancements to the pattern
- **Documentation**: Propose better ways to explain the architecture
- **Questions**: Ask in issues if you need clarification

This helps ensure your time is well spent and aligns with the project direction.

cd serverless-agents
git remote add upstream https://github.com/brookr/serverless-agents.git
```

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a branch for your feature or fix
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
