### 2. **Internal Services**
- **Pattern Detection** ↔ **Trading Execution**
- **Risk Management** ↔ **Position Monitoring**
- **Caching Layer** ↔ **API Services**
- **Monitoring** ↔ **All System Components**

## Data Flow Architecture

The system follows a event-driven architecture pattern with clear data flow:

1. **Pattern Detection** → **Signal Generation** → **Risk Assessment** → **Trade Execution**
2. **Market Data** → **Analysis** → **Pattern Matching** → **Alert Generation**
3. **User Input** → **Validation** → **Configuration** → **Service Updates**
