## swarm-development-centralized-1751150466028/architect/

### System Architecture Overview
- **Project Type**: AI-powered cryptocurrency trading bot (MEXC Sniper Bot)
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js 15.3.4, TypeScript, React 19, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design
- **Service Count**: 50+ microservices consolidated into 5 main domains

### Component Relationships
- **Presentation Layer**: React components with custom hooks, TanStack Query
- **Application Layer**: Use cases, DTOs, application services
- **Domain Layer**: Entities, value objects, domain events, specifications  
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database repositories, external API clients, caching

### Data Flow Analysis
- **Real-time WebSocket streams** from MEXC exchange for market data
- **AI-powered pattern detection** with confidence scoring
- **Multi-agent coordination** for trading decisions
- **Event-driven architecture** for loose coupling
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for resilience

### External API Integration Points

#### Trading & Market Data
- **MEXC Exchange API**: REST + WebSocket for trading and market data
- **Rate limiting**: Adaptive rate limiting for API quotas
- **Authentication**: Secure API key management with encryption

#### AI Services Integration
- **OpenAI API**: For advanced pattern analysis
- **Anthropic Claude**: Enhanced AI capabilities  
- **Perplexity API**: Research and market insights

- **Upstash Redis**: Caching and session management
- **Kinde Authentication**: User authentication and authorization
- **Inngest**: Workflow orchestration and scheduling
- **OpenTelemetry**: Observability and monitoring

### Security & Configuration
- **No hardcoded secrets**: All configuration via environment variables
- **Encryption service**: For sensitive API keys and credentials
- **Configuration validation**: Startup validation of all required vars
- **Modular boundaries**: Clean separation between domains

### Key Architectural Strengths
1. **Scalable microservice architecture** with clear domain boundaries
2. **Real-time trading capabilities** with WebSocket connections
3. **AI-enhanced decision making** with multiple provider fallbacks
4. **Comprehensive risk management** with emergency stop mechanisms
5. **Production-ready monitoring** and observability stack
6. **Type-safe throughout** with TypeScript and Zod validation

### Consolidation Strategy
- **Core Trading Service**: 25+ files consolidated (auto-sniping, multi-phase trading, MEXC APIs)
- **Market Data Service**: 12+ files consolidated (pattern detection, WebSocket, market data)
- **Risk Management Service**: 10+ files consolidated (safety, circuit breakers, risk assessment)
- **User Management Service**: 8+ files consolidated (configuration, validation, authentication)
- **Notification Service**: 6+ files consolidated (alerting, notification providers)

### Performance Optimizations
- **Bundle optimization** with Next.js dynamic imports
- **Database query optimization** with proper indexing
- **WebSocket connection pooling** for real-time data
- **AI service request batching** to reduce costs
- **Cache warming strategies** for frequently accessed data
