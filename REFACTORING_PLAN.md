# Comprehensive Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the remaining steps for the comprehensive codebase analysis and refactoring of the `mexc-sniper-bot` project.

## 1. Finalize Project Structure Cleanup

The initial cleanup of the root directory is underway. The following tasks will complete this process:

- **Move remaining test-related files from `scripts/` to `tests/`:**
  - `mv scripts/settings-verification-test.ts tests/`
  - `mv scripts/trading-system-validation.ts tests/`
  - `mv scripts/verify-implementations.ts tests/`
- **Remove redundant implementation verification script:**
  - `rm scripts/verify-implementations.js`
- **Move remaining scripts to the `scripts/` directory:**
  - `mv validate-backend.js scripts/`
  - `mv verify-backend-fixes.mjs scripts/`

## 2. Consolidate and Refactor `package.json` Scripts

The `package.json` file contains an excessive number of scripts, many of which are redundant or overly specific. The plan is to:

- **Group related scripts:** Consolidate testing scripts under a more unified command structure. For example, `test:fast`, `test:verbose`, and `test:emergency` could be flags on the main `test` script.
- **Remove legacy or unused scripts:** Eliminate scripts that are no longer relevant to the current development workflow.
- **Standardize script naming:** Ensure all scripts follow a consistent and predictable naming convention.

## 3. Analyze and Refactor Application Architecture (`src/` and `app/`)

A key objective is to improve the overall architecture and separation of concerns within the application. This will involve:

- **Analyze `src/` directory:**
  - Review the folder structure and identify opportunities for better module organization.
  - Propose a more domain-driven structure (e.g., `src/trading`, `src/core`, `src/user`).
  - Identify and refactor God objects or classes that violate the single-responsibility principle.
- **Analyze `app/` directory (Next.js):**
  - Review the component organization and ensure a clear separation between server and client components.
  - Consolidate duplicated UI components and extract shared logic into hooks or utilities.
  - Analyze API route handlers for business logic that should be moved to service layers.

## 4. Performance and Bundle Size Optimization

To improve the application's performance and reduce its footprint, the following actions will be taken:

- **Run bundle analysis:** Use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to visualize the application's bundle and identify large or unnecessary dependencies.
- **Optimize Next.js configuration:** Review `next.config.ts` for performance-enhancing settings, such as image optimization and caching strategies.
- **Analyze database queries:** Inspect the database interaction code for inefficient queries and implement optimizations where necessary.
- **Review frontend rendering:** Identify and fix unnecessary re-renders in React components using tools like the React DevTools profiler.

## 5. Review and Update Documentation

As the codebase is refactored, it is crucial to keep the documentation up-to-date. This includes:

- **Update `README.md`:** Reflect the new project structure and simplified script commands.
- **Document architectural decisions:** Create or update architecture-related documents to explain the new structure and design patterns.
- **Add inline code comments:** Clarify complex logic and document the purpose of critical functions and modules.

By following this plan, we will achieve a more maintainable, performant, and well-structured codebase.
