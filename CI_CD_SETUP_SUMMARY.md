   - Performance benchmarking

2. **Deploy Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
   - Automated staging deployment for PRs
   - Production deployment for main branch
   - Deployment validation testing
   - Emergency rollback capability

3. **Security Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
   - Daily security audits and vulnerability scanning
   - CodeQL static analysis
   - Secret scanning with TruffleHog
   - License compliance checking
   - OSSF Security Scorecard

4. **Release Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
   - Automated release creation with changelog
   - Release validation and deployment
   - Team notifications

5. **Environment Validation** (`.github/workflows/environment-validation.yml`)
   - Weekly environment health checks
   - Secrets and configuration validation
   - External service connectivity testing

### ‚úÖ Documentation Created

1. **Secrets Setup Guide** (`.github/SECRETS_SETUP.md`)
   - Complete list of required secrets
   - Step-by-step setup instructions
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Troubleshooting guide

2. **CI/CD Documentation** (`.github/CI_CD_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
   - Pipeline architecture overview
   - Workflow descriptions
   - Status badges
   - Development workflow guide
   - Troubleshooting and maintenance

## üöÄ Next Steps Required

### 1. Configure GitHub Repository Secrets

**üöÄ Automated Setup (Recommended):**
```bash
# Interactive setup - prompts for each secret
./.github/scripts/setup-secrets.sh

# Or batch setup from environment file
cp .env.secrets.template .env.secrets
# Edit .env.secrets with your values
./.github/scripts/setup-secrets-from-env.sh
```

**üìñ Manual Setup:** Navigate to GitHub repository `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`

**Required Secrets:**
- VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
- DATABASE_URL, MEXC_API_KEY, MEXC_SECRET_KEY
- OPENAI_API_KEY, KINDE_CLIENT_ID, KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET
- KINDE_ISSUER_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET

**üìã For detailed setup instructions:** See [`.github/PROGRAMMATIC_SECRETS_SETUP.md`](.github/PROGRAMMATIC_SECRETS_SETUP.md)

### 2. Set Up Vercel Integration

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
bun add -g vercel@latest

# Link your project
vercel link

# Configure environment variables for each environment
vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
vercel env add KINDE_CLIENT_ID production
# ... (add all required env vars)
```

### 3. Update Repository Information

Update the following in the CI/CD documentation:
- Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username
- Update repository URL references
- Customize team/contact information

### 4. Test the Pipeline

```bash
# Create a test branch and PR to validate:
git checkout -b test-ci-cd
git add .
git commit -m "feat: set up comprehensive CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin test-ci-cd

# Create PR to test staging deployment
# Merge to main to test production deployment
```
