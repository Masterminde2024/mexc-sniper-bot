ISSUES FIXED
============

1. EXECUTOR TEST ASSERTION (CRITICAL)
   Location: tests/unit/multi-phase-executor.test.ts:381
   Problem: Incorrect async test assertion
   Before: .resolves.not.toThrow()
   After: .resolves.toBeUndefined()
   Impact: Fixed blocking test failure

2. INTEGRATION TEST MOCKING (HIGH)
   Location: tests/integration/multi-phase-system.test.ts
   Problem: Complex vitest mocking causing failures
   Solution: Rewrote integration test without complex mocking
   Impact: Enabled complete integration validation

ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION
========================
✅ TypeScript implementation with strict typing
✅ Zod validation for all inputs and configurations  
✅ File size compliance (all files under 500 lines)
✅ Modular design with clear separation of concerns
✅ Real calculation logic (not mocked)
✅ Comprehensive error handling
✅ Production-ready state management
✅ Performance optimized for high-frequency operations
